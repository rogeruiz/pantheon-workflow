Because of this, I made node cli-tooling based off of [migrating instructions I found here](https://pantheon.io/blog/importing-large-wordpress-sites-pantheon).\r\n\r\n### This project is still very much a work in progress.\r\n\r\nTo get started, just run `npm install` & run the main binary from `./bin/paw`:\r\n\r\n##### commands\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n❯ ./bin/paw media up project_name\r\n❯ ./bin/paw media down project_name\r\n❯ # ./bin/paw db <direction> project_name\r\n❯ # ./bin/paw sync <direction> project_name # do both db + media\r\n❯ # go forth & prosper\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### preferences\r\n\r\nSetup a .pantheonrc in your $HOME directory or in the current directory. The structure of the file should be valid JSON in this format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"project_name\": {\r\n    \"uuid\": \"4cc6-eec512c3-a57d-0267788fabbc-97bb\",\r\n    \"db\": \"wordpress_project_name\",\r\n    \"env\": \"dev\",\r\n    \"root\": \"$HOME/Developer/vvv/www/project_name/htdocs/\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry putting a Pantheon project into the local .pantheonrc file and run `./bin/paw media <direction> <project>`.\r\n","google":"UA-44442010-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
