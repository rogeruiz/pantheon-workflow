Because of this, I made node cli-tooling based off of [migrating instructions I found here](https://pantheon.io/blog/importing-large-wordpress-sites-pantheon).\r\n\r\n### This project is still very much a work in progress.\r\n\r\nTo get started, just run `npm install` & run the main binary from `./bin/paw`:\r\n\r\n##### commands\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n❯ ./bin/paw db -p project_name\r\n❯ ./bin/paw media -p project_name\r\n❯ ./bin/paw sync -p project_name # do both db + sync\r\n❯ # go forth & prosper\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### preferences\r\n\r\nSetup a .pantheonrc in your $HOME directory or in the current directory.
